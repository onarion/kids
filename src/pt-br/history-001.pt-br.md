### Letra Completa

```text
Olha o que eu achei no chão,
Uma sementinha na mão.
É uma semente que brilha...
Vamos plantar com a família!

O Tico sabe o lugar,
Mas tem uma ponte pra passar.
Eu tenho medo de ir lá,
Minhas perninhas vão parar.

Coragem, coragem, meu amiguinho,
É dar um passo de cada vez, bem de mansinho.
Uma mãozinha pra ajudar
E você consegue atravessar.

Belinha pegou sua mão,
E cantou esta canção.
Tico deu um passo, então,
Bateu forte o coração.

Coragem, coragem, meu amiguinho,
É dar um passo de cada vez, bem de mansinho.
Uma mãozinha pra ajudar
E a gente consegue atravessar.

Um passinho, depois dois,
Tico sorriu e continuou!
O outro lado ele alcançou,
E a turminha comemorou!

Coragem, coragem, nosso amigo,
É dar um passo e ter a gente aqui contigo!
Um passinho de cada vez, bem de mansinho,
Juntos achamos o caminho!

A semente eu já plantei!
E uma flor linda, olhem, eu sei...
...brilhou!
```
