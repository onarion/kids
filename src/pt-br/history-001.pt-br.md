### Letra Completa

```text
(Verso 1)
O mundo acordou
Sem nenhuma cor
Só cinza e tristinho
Sem vida e sem flor

(Refrão)
Oh, que confusão!
Cadê a alegria?
Vamos encontrar
A rima do dia!

(Verso 2)
Belinha encontrou
Um sapo no chão
Ele era verdinho
E trouxe a canção

(Refrão)
Oh, que confusão!
Cadê a alegria?
Vamos encontrar
A rima do dia!

(Verso 3)
Depois uma joaninha
Pousou no nariz
Com seu vermelhinho
Me fez mais feliz

(Refrão)
Oh, que confusão!
Cadê a alegria?
Vamos encontrar
A rima do dia!

(Ponte)
O céu ficou azul
O sol amarelo surgiu
Com todos os amigos
O prado sorriu!

(Refrão Final)
Que bela união!
Cheia de alegria!
Nós encontramos
A rima do dia!
```

Sem vida e sem flor
